# AI-Driven-Debate-Simulator
AI-Driven Debate Simulator leverages OpenAI's API to simulate a structured debate on a specified topic between two opposing sides. It dynamically generates arguments based on conversation history and assesses the debate to determine a winner. This project demonstrates advanced argumentation and summarization capabilities using AI.
