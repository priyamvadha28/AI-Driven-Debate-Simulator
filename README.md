# AI-Driven-Debate-Simulator
The AI-Driven Debate Simulator is a Python-based project designed to simulate a debate between two classes using OpenAI's API. It generates arguments for each side of a debate, evaluates the conversation, and determines a winner based on the conversation history. The simulator uses OpenAIâ€™s API to create debate arguments and summarize the debate, allowing users to observe how an AI can handle complex debate scenarios.

Functionality:
- Argument Generation: The simulator generates arguments for each side of the debate based on a predefined topic. It ensures that each argument is unique and relevant to the ongoing discussion.
- Debate Simulation: The debate alternates between the two classes, with each side providing arguments in turn. The conversation history is updated with each new argument.
- Winner Determination: After a set number of turns, the simulator summarizes the debate and determines the winner based on the overall conversation.

Setup:

1. Prerequisites:
Python 3.8 or higher
OpenAI API key

2. Installation:

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages: 
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configuration:
Obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it in the code where indicated.

Usage:

1.Edit the Code:
- Update the openai_api_key with your OpenAI API credentials.
- Modify the debate_topic and classes as needed for different debate scenarios.

2. Run the Script:
- Execute the script using Python:
pyhon debate_simulator.py

- The script will output the arguments from each side of the debate and the final winner.
